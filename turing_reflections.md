### Mod 1 - Week 1

**To start, go ahead and make an object or two.**
```
  var bed = {
    size: 'full',
    made: false,
    brand: 'Bear',
    sleepNumber: 4
  }

  var cow = {
    name: 'Gerry',
    breed: 'normal cow',
    age: 24
    favoriteSpots: ['under the tree', 'in the meadow']
  }
```
**How do you create an object using literal notation?**

You use key-value pairs to denote the properties of the object, with the (keyName, colon, value,) and commas after each pair and wrapped in the curly braces:
```
  var objectName = {
    key: 'pairValue',
    key1: 12,
    key2: false,
    key3: ['example', 'array']
  }

```
**What is an object and what is it made up of?**

An object is a data type used to store key-value pairs, or properties, and function to be used on those properties, or methods.

**When we assign a function as the value of a key inside an object, what do we call it?**

We call it a method.

**What is a statement?**

A statement is an individual instruction that the computer can follow, often best followed by a semicolon.

**What is an expression?**

An expression is a statement that produces a single value. Often the result of operators acting some modification on a value or values to create a single output.It produces a single value, so it can be written wherever a value is expected (like in template literals).

**Give examples of both.**

A statement could be:
```
  'string';
  42;
  console.log('hi');
```

An expression could be:
```
  4 + 4;
  var cat = 'Gravy';
  3 < 5;
```
**Has your understanding of the differences between statements and expressions changed at all?**

Yes, all expressions are statements but only some statements are expressions. Because an expression returns a value, it can be used in place of a value within code.

**What questions remain?**

What are all the possible places you can use an expression value?

**Where might you ask that question?**

Google. Stack Overflow. The Slack for our cohort. Class.

**What are the five primitive data types we learned about today?**
**How are variables useful and what is an example of one that has a value assigned to it?**
**Write out an example of string concatenation. **Now write that same example using a template literal.**
**Write out the basic structure of an if/else conditional.**
**Write down at least one question you have coming out of this lesson.**
